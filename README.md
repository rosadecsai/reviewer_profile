# The reviewer's profile in peer-review of a manuscript by goal, effort and performance
We have empirically studied the reviewer’s profile by three features: the goal intentions, the effort needed to achieve that goal intentions, and performance in evaluating the manuscript in peer review.For this, we have used the data collected from tha answers to a survey for authors of different journals.
